## 4. 🛠 Getting Started (Setup & Installation)

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK
- SQL Server (or change connection string for another provider)
- (Optional) Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

### Installation Steps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/internship-management-system.git
cd internship-management-system

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Update database (run migrations)
cd Infrastructure
dotnet ef database update

# Run the API
cd ../WebApi
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at **https://localhost:5001** (or as configured).

Access Swagger UI at **https://localhost:5001/swagger**.

**Note:**

## 6. 🧪 Testing

- Unit & Integration Tests:
  - Located in `InternshipManagement.Tests/`
  - Uses xUnit and Moq for mocking dependencies
  - InMemory database setup for isolated, repeatable tests

Run all tests:
```bash
dotnet test
```

The test factory (`TestWebApplicationFactory`) configures the API to use an InMemory database for fast, reliable testing.
